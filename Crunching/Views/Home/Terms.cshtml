                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users accept the currently valid terms and conditions of use when they register as GTP Toolbox users. This is done by activating a check box during the registration procedure to declare their agreement to said terms and conditions. This agreement may be withdrawn at any time using [INTERNETADRESSE]. Agreements made between GTP Toolbox users and the vendor will not be stored by the vendor for the user.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.2</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contract language is German. Only the German version is binding and not any translation hereof or of other documents related to the agreement.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.3</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vendor is entitled to change these terms and conditions at any time if changes in legislation, case law, market conditions or other reasons that could not have been foreseen by them when making contract per 3.2 herein and over which they have no control make same necessary. They will advise GTP Toolbox users of same by e-mail or emphasised information in the log in procedure. GTP Toolbox users have the option to reject any such change by sending an e-mail message to [E-MAIL-ADRESSE] or sending such rejection by post in writing within thirty days of receipt of the advice of any such change. If they do not do so or continue to use the vendor&rsquo;s applicable goods and services, then this shall be considered acceptance of any and all said change/s. We will advise users hereof in our advice of any such change/s. If any GTP Toolbox user rejects such change/s then the earlier terms and conditions remain in effect. In such cases the vendor may serve notice of termination of membership per clause herein within two weeks of receipt of any such rejection. Changes due to any obligation/s of the contracting parties the performance of which is only possible due to GTP Toolbox use and on which the respective other contracting party/parties hereto regularly rely or may so rely (hereinafter called major contractual duties) are excepted from this right to make change/s.</span></p>

                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.1</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vendor will make the GTP Toolbox available in the manner in which it was available when the user registered as such. In all other respects GTP Toolbox users have no right to any specific GTP Toolbox design or characteristics. The vendor reserves the right to change or to abandon the GTP Toolbox.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.2</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GTP Toolbox provides a digital information system that permits users thereof to ease their daily burdens at work, to contact the vendor and to access current information on the vendor&rsquo;s products using intelligent tools. The GTP Toolbox includes all standard formulae for calculating cast parts in a mathematical module. Such calculation depends in individual cases on a variety of factors that have to be determined and that cannot be finally recorded or determined by the GTP Toolbox. On site analysis by an expert is essential to doing so. GTP Toolbox users can contact the vendor via the Toolbox for such purposes. In view of the foregoing the parties hereto agree that the data calculated using the online platform and the vendor&rsquo;s information hereon are not binding where technical matters are concerned.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.3</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vendor is responsible for providing goods and services with characteristics going above and beyond those in clause 2.1 only if same have been expressly promised the respective user in writing.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.4</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GTP Toolbox is provided its users solely as a programme executable in their browser or via an application using the operating system released by the vendor for such purposes. The vendor has no obligation to hand over or make accessible any source code on which the application is based or any interface definition.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.5</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GTP Toolbox is supplied on the Internet. GTP Toolbox users are responsible for ensuring they have the necessary Internet access.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.6</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vendor only makes the GTP Toolbox available as a technical platform for users to employ in utilising their content.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.7</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.7 Direct or indirect reference to external content such as that on other web sites may be provided via links in the GTP Toolbox. Such content is clearly labelled using hyper links or discernible due to being accessed using a browser that can be differentiated from that in the application or differentiated via a change in the address line in the browser. The vendor cannot accept any responsibility whatsoever for the content of web sites other than their own. Said responsibility lies wholly and solely with the operator/s thereof. Clause 7 remains unaffected hereby.</span></p>

                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A specific form on the web site or in one of the applications is used to register, employing a membership name and password (hereinafter called access data). The data entered therein may be amended until the form is sent off. GTP Toolbox users submit a legally binding application to the vendor by clicking the "[BESCHRIFTUNG]" button. Same will be promptly accepted or rejected by vendor. A contract is made between vendor and GTP Toolbox user on acceptance of same.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.3</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid misuse a request to confirm registration by using a link in said request is sent the e-mail address in the form. This is known as a two click solution. GTP Toolbox users may add data to their membership profile and amend or delete information already included therein at any time.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.4</span></p>

Every GTP Toolbox user has a duty to check the data in the profiles of other members where indicated.</span></p>

                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access data are stored in a protocol file every time GTP Toolbox is invoked. These contain the browser type and version, operating system used, the accessing processor's host name (IP address), and the server query's clock time. These data are not associated with particular persons. No combination of these data with other data sources is made. The log data are each completely deleted after no more than three months. They are not archived and are used for protection of the Web site during the investigation of abuse cases.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.2 Registration</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must register as a member before you use GTP Toolbox so that you can access contents and services that are offered only to registered users. We will then collect additional personal data from you, store them, and process and use them in connection with our service. We need your name and contact data so that we can provide you with the desired contractual services. We use these data only to the extent necessary for provision of the service. Changing or deleting the data provided during registration is possible at any time. Your data are deleted after completed contract execution if you haven't expressly consented to data use extending further or statutory record-retention obligations exist. If we are legally obligated to retain the data after termination of your membership, we will first block the data and thereafter delete it when the retention period expires.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.3 Use</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the GTP Toolbox is basically possible without the user having to disclose personal data in whole or in part to the provider. If the provider does collect personal data such as name or email addresses, it is always done as far as possible on a voluntary basis or with the possibility of acting under a pseudonym.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal data may be disclosed when using the function for contacting us. It is therefore up to the user alone to decide whether to contact us and to transmit personal data for this purpose. We will collect, store, and process the personal data that you transmit to us to handle the user's request. Combination with master data does not occur.</span></p>
                                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Global Positioning System (GPS) for instance can collect the user's current location while GTP Ttoolbox is being used. The location data are transmitted via an encrypted connection. We are not able to identify the user personally with the location data, but we can infer that the sometimes anonymous user is located in a particular vicinity or at a particular place. Location investigation serves to provide the user with the most comfortable customer service possible, in particular being able to select the locally competent customer service representative with whom the user can then make contact. The user can suppress the transmission of location data at any time by withdrawing authorization to use the location from gtp-toolbox in the respective operating system.</span></p>
